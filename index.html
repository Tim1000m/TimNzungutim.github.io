    <h3> Camp Castor (3/07/2023-7/07/2023) <h3>
      
      <p>Camp castor is a scout camp where I've been a cook for the last years and also have made some really good friends. 
        Every year I get the chance to meet some new people with different life experiences, but also totally different mentalities. 
          They are funny, bright and a strong scout that looks out for each other and also look out for the ones that  
          they take under their care. </p>
      
      <p>This time, I only went for two 4 days. During these 4 days we managed to build and finish some construction that was planned beforehead. We build a stilt house in wich we could
          sleep and store all are bags with clothing in. Every day was a day where people could come and go. Our group started with 7, then went to 15 and at the end with 5, but even
          with only 5 we managed to have a really great time. I think that the funniest thing that we've done during my days there was going to the townn's swimming pool by car just to take a shower
          and go back to camp. After having done a lot of work at the camp, we unfortunately came to the end of my stay, but I was relieved to hear from the guys that they wanted me to stay. And
          so I made them a promise. After the DOUR festival, I would come back to the camp for one last night of fun and ofcourse a group picture to remember our time together. </p>
