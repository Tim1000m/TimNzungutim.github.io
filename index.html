    <h3> Camp Castor (3/07/2023-7/07/2023) <h3>
      
      <p>Camp castor is a scout camp where I've been a cook for the last years and also have made some really good friends. 
        Every year I get the chance to meet some new people with different life experiences, but also totally different mentalities. 
          They are a funny, bright and a strong scout that looks out for each other and also look out for the ones that  
          they take under their care. </p>
      
      <p>This time, I only went for two 4 days. During these 4 days we managed to build and finish some construction that was planned beforehead. We build a stilt house in wich we could
          sleep and store all are bags with clothing in. Every day was a day where people could come and go. Our group started with 7, then went to 15 and at the end with 5, but even
          with only 5 we managed to have a really great time. I think that the funniest thing that we've done during my days there was going to the townn's swimming pool by car just to take a shower
          and go back to camp. After having done a lot of work at the camp, we unfortunately came to the end of my stay, but I was relieved to hear from the guys that they wanted me to stay. And
          so I made them a promise. After the DOUR festival, I would come back to the camp for one last night of fun and ofcourse a group picture to remember our time together. </p>
      
    <h3> Dour festival (12/07/2023-17/07/2023) <h3>
      <p> The Dour Festival was a fantastic event in Belgium that I attended with my engineering faculty friends. Many might think of festivals as just big events to see known artists and enjoy their music, but Dour was different. 
          When someone mentions Dour, they actually mean camping. What stood out to me was that the festival's camping area was conveniently close to the main festival grounds. 
          This meant we could stay at the camping area for as long as we wanted and only leave when the concert was about to start in half an hour. It allowed us to spend more time chilling with friends or even making new ones. 
          The festival's small size also made it easy to bump into friends and move between stages within 10 minutes.
          What I will always cherish about this experience is being with my friends (Arno, Britt, Bao, Jarno, Egon, Sasha, and Leatitia) and camping together. Spending the day with them made me realize the importance of social contact and friendship. 
          We enjoyed watching numerous artists together and danced to the craziest music. We laughed and playfully argued over random things, which made it even more enjoyable. Despite the limited time we had, I can honestly say it was a great success.    </p>

    <h3> That one evening at Camp castor (17/07/2023 - 18/07/2023) <h3>
      <p> When you make a promise to someone, it is important to respect that. And so I did. So, Bao and I took off for the village of Gesves to return to Camp Castor, where I had stayed some weeks earlier.
          The journey was long, but we made a much-needed stop at the Quick restaurant, which made the trip easier as it filled our bellies. With our energy replenished, we continued on to Gesves. 
          During the drive, I had to stay awake while Bao seemed to be spacing out at times, but we eventually arrived at the camp.
          Upon our arrival, we drove onto the grass field with loud music, hoping for a warm welcome from many friends. However, our expectations were a little too high. 
          Only Wombat (Benoit) was there to greet us, as everyone else was involved in an activity close to Namur. 
          Thankfully, Wombat was kind enough to offer us some Irish Coffee, so we still had a pleasant welcome. 
          Some time passed, and after a cozy siesta outside, the others finally arrived by car, waking me up from my rest
          We spent the evening talking, laughing, and enjoying a meal together. Later, we played some games that kept us awake until 4 o'clock in the morning. 
          Usually, I set an alarm to wake up, but this time Bao had a different idea. To my surprise, I woke up in the tent next to a stuffed wild boar that Bao had used to wake me up. 
          It freaked me out!</p>

    <h3> The cirle of fire (29/07/2023)
      <p> When encountering the title 'The Circle of Fire,' it's natural for many to anticipate a narrative reminiscent of a Lord of the Rings tale, and in some ways, it does bear resemblance. 
          However, this story does not feature trolls or wizards, and our adventures haven't led us across vast distances or to majestic castles. Nevertheless, what I can assure you is that our journey has been one of traversing and mastering time collectively,
          culminating in the creation of our cherished haven, known as the Bar PK. 
          In fact, you could even dub us "the fellowship of the Bar PK" to remain aligned with our chosen theme...</p>
