    <h3> Camp Castor (3/07/2023-7/07/2023) <h3>
      
      <p>Camp castor is a scouts camp where I've been a cook for the last years and also have made some really good friends. Every year I get the chance to meet some new people with
          different life experiences, but also totally different mentalities. They are funny, bright and a strong scouts that looks out for each other and also look out for the ones that  
          they take under their care. </p>
      <br/>
      <p>This time, I only went for two 4 days, but in these days we still were possible to finish the stilt house and our beds within it. </p>
