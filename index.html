    <h3> Camp Castor (3/07/2023-7/07/2023) <h3>
    <div class= "columnss">  
      <p>Camp castor is a scout camp where I've been a cook for the last years and also have made some really good friends. 
        Every year I get the chance to meet some new people with different life experiences, but also totally different mentalities. 
          They are a funny, bright and a strong scout that looks out for each other and also look out for the ones that  
          they take under their care. </p>

      <p>This time, I only went for two 4 days. During these 4 days we managed to build and finish some construction that was planned beforehead. We build a stilt house in wich we could
          sleep and store all are bags with clothing in. Every day was a day where people could come and go. Our group started with 7, then went to 15 and at the end with 5, but even
          with only 5 we managed to have a really great time. </p>
      <p>I think that the funniest thing that we've done during my days there was going to the townn's swimming pool by car just to take a shower
          and go back to camp. After having done a lot of work at the camp, we unfortunately came to the end of my stay, but I was relieved to hear from the guys that they wanted me to stay. And
          so I made them a promise. After the DOUR festival, I would come back to the camp for one last night of fun and ofcourse a group picture to remember our time together. </p>

    <h3> Dour festival (12/07/2023-17/07/2023) <h3>
    <div class= "columnss">
      <p> The Dour Festival was a fantastic event in Belgium that I attended with my engineering faculty friends. Many might think of festivals as just big events to see known artists and enjoy their music, but Dour was different. 
          When someone mentions Dour, they actually mean camping. What stood out to me was that the festival's camping area was conveniently close to the main festival grounds. </p>
       <p> This meant we could stay at the camping area for as long as we wanted and only leave when the concert was about to start in half an hour. It allowed us to spend more time chilling with friends or even making new ones. 
          The festival's small size also made it easy to bump into friends and move between stages within 10 minutes.</p>
       <p>What I will always cherish about this experience is being with my friends (Arno, Britt, Bao, Jarno, Egon, Sasha, and Leatitia) and camping together. Spending the day with them made me realize the importance of social contact and friendship. 
          We enjoyed watching numerous artists together and danced to the craziest music. We laughed and playfully argued over random things, which made it even more enjoyable. Despite the limited time we had, I can honestly say it was a great success. </p>

    <h3> That one evening at Camp castor (17/07/2023 - 18/07/2023) <h3>
    <div class= "columnss">
      <p> When you make a promise to someone, it is important to respect that. And so I did. So, Bao and I took off for the village of Gesves to return to Camp Castor, where I had stayed some weeks earlier.
          The journey was long, but we made a much-needed stop at the Quick restaurant, which made the trip easier as it filled our bellies. With our energy replenished, we continued on to Gesves. 
          During the drive, I had to stay awake while Bao seemed to be spacing out at times, but we eventually arrived at the camp.
          Upon our arrival, we drove onto the grass field with loud music, hoping for a warm welcome from many friends. However, our expectations were a little too high. 
          Only Wombat (Benoit) was there to greet us, as everyone else was involved in an activity close to Namur. 
          Thankfully, Wombat was kind enough to offer us some Irish Coffee, so we still had a pleasant welcome. 
          Some time passed, and after a cozy siesta outside, the others finally arrived by car, waking me up from my rest
          We spent the evening talking, laughing, and enjoying a meal together. Later, we played some games that kept us awake until 4 o'clock in the morning. 
          Usually, I set an alarm to wake up, but this time Bao had a different idea. To my surprise, I woke up in the tent next to a stuffed wild boar that Bao had used to wake me up. 
          It freaked me out!</p>

    <h3> The cirle of fire (29/07/2023)
    <div class= "columnss">
      <p> When encountering the title 'The Circle of Fire,' it's natural for many to anticipate a narrative reminiscent of a Lord of the Rings tale, and in some ways, it does bear resemblance. 
          However, this story does not feature trolls or wizards, and our adventures haven't led us across vast distances or to majestic castles. Nevertheless, what I can assure you is that our journey has been one of traversing and mastering time collectively,
          culminating in the creation of our cherished haven, known as the Bar PK. 
          In fact, you could even dub us "the fellowship of the Bar PK" to remain aligned with our chosen theme...</p>

    <h3> Soldering at Sasha's home (12/08/2023) <h3> 
    <div class= "columnss">  
      <p> Friendship is a subject of profound philosophical significance that has intrigued thinkers throughout history. Aristotle, one of the earliest philosophers to explore friendship, regarded it as the highest form of ethical relationship. True friends, he believed, wish for each other's well-being, and in nurturing these bonds, individuals cultivate virtues like trust, honesty, and empathy, forming the foundation of ethical living.
        Metaphysically, friendship challenges the conventional notion of a discrete self. When we forge deep connections with friends, the boundary between "I" and "you" blurs. Our identities become interwoven with theirs, suggesting that friendship involves a mutual creation of the self. Existentially, friends serve as mirrors, reflecting our thoughts and actions. The gaze of friends, as discussed by existentialist thinkers like Sartre, plays a pivotal role in our self-awareness.
        In essence, friendship raises essential questions about human nature, ethics, and the quest for a meaningful life. It is not merely a social construct but a transformative force that shapes our character, challenges our understanding of selfhood, and deepens our awareness of our own existence. As a cornerstone of the human experience, friendship enriches our philosophical understanding of life, offering insights into the complexities of human relationships and the pursuit of a virtuous and meaningful existence.</p>

    <h3>Skydiving (3/09/2023)<h3>
    <div class= "columnss">  
      <p> It all began at a table where we discussed our life goals. One of us suggested skydiving, but there was a hurdle: the cost. Initially priced at 250 euros per person, we managed to secure a discount during the reservation, bringing the cost down to 210 euros each.</p>
       <p> So, we devised a creative payment plan. Every week, we each contributed 5 euros to a jar until, after a year, we had enough to go skydiving.Skipping ahead to the night before the big day, it was a tough one. We faced a mosquito infestation at Marcio's place.</p>
       <p> Despite winning most mosquito battles, I had to surrender at 6 o'clock. Keep in mind, our departure time from Overijse to Genk was set for 7:45.Once we arrived at the airport, things moved quickly. We had an 86-minute wait, but the excitement and the delightful company of a Hawaiian couple, who had stayed at the Schuttenbeld's home, made time fly by.</p>
        <p>After some drinks and plenty of laughter, it was finally our turn to jump. We boarded the plane, ascended to 4 kilometers, and then it was time. As Marcio and Harry descended, I hovered between safety and free fall, solid ground and a 4-kilometer void. The first thing that struck me while plummeting was that the rush coursing through my veins wasn't stress or cold, but pure excitement. 
        It was the realization that dreams could become reality through consistency. We free-fell for what felt like 10-20 seconds before deploying our parachutes. After a few minutes of gliding through the air and even some self-reflection, we touched down. Marcio and I had successfully completed our skydiving adventure. Check! </p>

     <h3> Xer Kasteelhoeve (9/09/2023) <h3>
    <div class= "columnss">  
      <p> The Druivenstreek is a region steeped in history, renowned for its rich grape heritage, and it's also my beloved home. It's a place where people of all ages come together to celebrate every festivity, and where friendships are forged to last a lifetime. As we wander through its charming streets, we often reflect on those who will always greet us with a warm smile or genuine happiness upon our return. In the Druivenstreek, this warm camaraderie is a common thread that binds everyone.

During my younger years in the Druivenstreek, I had the pleasure of meeting a plethora of people, many of whom remain close friends to this day. Although we may not see each other as frequently as we once did, I can assure you that when our paths do cross, you're in for a treasure trove of nostalgic stories from our shared past.

The people of the Druivenstreek have a penchant for attending events and reveling in merriment, and it's no surprise that many of our friends also happen to be passionate party organizers. This leads to joyous gatherings where we can all come together once again to celebrate, dance, and have a blast. Recently, our friends organized a party in a picturesque Kasteelhoeve with some talented house DJs who had the crowd grooving all night. It was also a special occasion as I introduced some of my friends from Brussels to the charms of the Druivenstreek, 
        creating wonderful memories. However, above all else, the highlight of the party was reuniting with my dear friends.</p>
